# About this project

This is a web site designed by [Alex Gonzalez](https://twitter.com/aggurio) for TASka, Taller Alicja Scigaczewska.

It is based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), using [Poole](http://getpoole.com) and the Hyde template.

The following are also used:

- compass
- zocial
- Jekyll Asset Pipeline
- jQuery
- Pure.css
- FlexSlider

# Build instructions

To build and launch the web server at http://localhost:4000/:

    bundle exec jekyll serve --detach --watch

From then on you can rebuild with:

    bundle exec jekyll build --watch

We use bundle to separate the project's gem dependencies from the system wide ones. This is controlled by the enclosed Gemfile.
